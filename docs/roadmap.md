# Roadmap
{:.doc-subtitle}
LCCC improves CCC in twenty numbered phases (1–20 + PGO8–11 **complete** as history). **That is not “done vs GCC.”**

**Current (2026-08-20):** linear-scan RA is production; gzip `longest_match` still **118 vs 0** stack-mem vs GCC; Adler kernel **1.49×**; Expat scan **1.95×**. See `lccc-improvements/register-allocation/VALIDATION_ZLIB_GZIP_EXPAT.md` and `hotspots/RESEARCH_BACKLOG.md`.

Geomean-on-micros faster than GCC does **not** imply codecs/parsers are won.

## Phase 1 — Register Allocator Analysis (Complete)

**Goal:** Understand the current allocator, measure its limitations, and design a replacement.

**Deliverables:**
- `CURRENT_ALLOCATOR_ANALYSIS.md` — deep analysis of the three-phase greedy allocator (350 lines)
- `LINEAR_SCAN_DESIGN.md` — complete algorithm specification (500 lines)
- `INTEGRATION_POINTS.md` — exact call sites, data flow, interface requirements (350 lines)

**Key findings:**
- The old allocator only considers ~5% of IR values eligible (very conservative whitelist)
- No interval splitting or spill-cost-based eviction — all-or-nothing allocation
- Phase 1 excluded non-call-spanning values from callee-saved registers entirely
- 32-variable function: 11KB stack frame, 0 registers allocated (all spilled)

---

## Phase 2 — Linear Scan Register Allocator (Complete)

**Goal:** Replace the three-phase greedy allocator with a proper linear scan.

**What changed** (`src/backend/`):
- `live_range.rs` — new: `LiveRange`, `ActiveInterval`, `LinearScanAllocator` (796 lines)
- `regalloc.rs` — `allocate_registers()` now runs two-pass linear scan

**Algorithm:** Poletto & Sarkar (1999) linear scan with priority-based eviction:
1. Build enhanced live ranges with loop-depth-weighted priorities
2. Process intervals in order of start point
3. Expire ended intervals, freeing their registers
4. Assign a free register or evict the lowest-weight active interval
5. Second pass: assign caller-saved registers to unallocated non-call-spanning values

**Results:**
- `arith_loop` (32 vars): 0.124s vs 0.149s — **+20% faster** than CCC (before Phase 3b)
- `sieve`: 0.037s vs 0.044s — **+19% faster** than CCC
- 500 upstream tests pass; all benchmark outputs identical to GCC

---

## Phase 3a — Tail-Call Elimination (Complete)

**Goal:** Convert self-recursive tail calls to back-edge branches, eliminating stack frames
for accumulator-style recursive functions.

**What changed** (`src/passes/`):
- `tail_call_elim.rs` — new: `tail_calls_to_loops()` pass (747 lines)
- `mod.rs` — TCE runs once after inlining, before the main optimization loop

**Algorithm:** A tail call is a recursive call whose result is returned immediately with no
further computation. TCE converts it to a loop by:
1. Inserting a loop header block with one Phi per parameter
2. Renaming parameter references in the body to use the Phi outputs
3. Replacing the tail call + return with assignments to the Phi inputs + unconditional branch

The resulting loop is then optimized by LICM, IVSR, and GVN in the normal pipeline.

**Results:**
- `tce_sum`: 0.008s vs 1.09s — **139× faster** than CCC (matches GCC exactly)
- Zero regressions on 508 unit tests

**Pass name:** `tce` (disable with `CCC_DISABLE_PASSES=tce`)

---

## Phase 3b — Phi-Copy Stack Slot Coalescing (Complete)

**Goal:** Eliminate the redundant stack-to-stack copies that phi elimination creates for
spilled loop variables.

**Root cause:** When CCC's phi elimination lowers SSA phi nodes to Copy instructions, each
loop variable `%i` gets a separate copy per predecessor:
- Entry: `%i = Copy 0`
- Backedge: `%i = Copy %i_next`

Because `%i` is now "multi-defined", the existing copy coalescing refused to share slots
between `%i` and `%i_next`. This produced ~20 redundant `movq mem, %rax; movq %rax, mem`
pairs per iteration in a 32-variable loop.

**Fix:** For the phi-copy pattern — where `%i_next` is defined and killed in the backedge
block (sole use = the Copy), and `%i` is used in other blocks (the loop header) — alias in
the *reversed* direction: `%i_next` borrows `%i`'s wider-live slot. The backedge copy
becomes a same-slot no-op and is dropped by `generate_copy`.

The key insight: `%i` being multi-defined only means it's the slot *owner* (written in
multiple predecessors). The *aliased* value `%i_next` is always single-defined, making the
alias safe.

**What changed** (`src/backend/stack_layout/copy_coalescing.rs`):
- Moved `multi_def_values.contains(&d)` check from the early combined guard to after the
  phi-copy pattern branch — multi-def is fine for the slot owner, never for the aliased value

**Results:**
- `arith_loop`: 0.124s → **0.104s** (+19% additional speedup on top of Phase 2)
- Combined Phase 2+3b vs CCC: **+41% faster** on the 32-variable loop benchmark

---

## Phase 4 — Loop Unrolling + FP Intrinsic Lowering (Complete)

**Goal:** Reduce loop-overhead on small inner loops; lower FP intrinsics to native SSE2/AVX ops.

**What changed:**
- `src/passes/loop_unroll.rs` — new: `unroll_loops()` pass (1299 lines, 6 unit tests)
- `src/passes/mod.rs` — loop_unroll runs at iter=0, before GVN/LICM
- `src/backend/x86/codegen/intrinsics.rs` — FP scalar/packed intrinsic lowering
- `src/backend/x86/codegen/peephole/` — additional peephole patterns for FP ops

**Loop unrolling algorithm:** "unroll with intermediate exit checks" — replicate body K times,
insert an IV-increment + Cmp + CondBranch between each copy. Any trip count is handled
correctly by whichever intermediate check fires; no cleanup loop.

Eligibility: ≤8 body-work blocks, single latch, preheader, no calls/atomics, constant IV step,
detectable exit condition (Cmp with loop-invariant limit).

Unroll factors: 8× for ≤8 body instructions, 4× for 9–20, 2× for 21–60.

**Results:**
- `matmul`: 0.027s → **0.020s** (+35% faster) — FP intrinsic lowering
- `sieve`: counting loop unrolled 8× (marking loop has variable step, not unrolled)
- `arith_loop`: 0.103s (body too large, 291 instructions — not unrolled by this pass)
- 514 tests pass (6 new loop_unroll unit tests)

**Pass name:** `unroll` (disable with `CCC_DISABLE_PASSES=unroll`)

See the [Phase 4 write-up](/lccc/updates/phase4-loop-unrolling) for full details.

---

## Phase 5 — SIMD / Auto-Vectorization (Complete)

**Status:** The original gap (matmul 4.86× slower because GCC emitted
`vfmadd231pd` while LCCC emitted scalar `mulsd`/`addsd`) is closed. LCCC now:

- lowers FP intrinsics to native SSE2/AVX2 ops (Phases 4, 6, 7a);
- **auto-vectorizes reduction loops** (sum, dot) to 4-wide AVX2 / 2-wide SSE2
  (Phase 8), beating GCC `-O3` on simple reductions by ~2.7×;
- handles arbitrary trip counts via remainder loops (Phase 7b);
- uses indexed (SIB) addressing (Phase 9) to collapse `base+index*scale` array
  accesses; and
- was **refactored to a codegen-backed intrinsic model** (`c1963642`) shared by
  the x86/ARM/RISC-V backends, eliminating a parallel intrinsic-lowering layer.

`matmul` now runs at ~parity with GCC on x86-64. The remaining vectorization
work is breadth (NEON/RVV, more loop patterns, prefetch), not the core x86 FP
vectorizer.

## Phase 6 — Profile-Guided Optimization (Complete)

**Status:** PGO is fully integrated as the `src/pgo/` module (v8–v11), with a
GCC-compatible flag surface:

```bash
# generate + train
ccc -O2 -fprofile-generate=/tmp/pgd main.c -o train   # instrumented build
./train                                                 # run with real data
# use
ccc -O2 -fprofile-use=/tmp/pgd main.c -o main          # profile-guided build
```

What PGO currently drives:

- **Edge-based profiling** — Knuth–Stevenson minimal edge counting with a
  maximum-weight directed arborescence (exact loop-latch counts via flow
  conservation), indirect-call value profiling, and fail-closed loading.
- **Profile summary** — an LLVM `ProfileSummaryInfo` analogue with a *dominance*
  hot/cold test (`has_spread`): the profile is only treated as informative when
  one function uniquely dominates the runner-up, so flat profiles never perturb
  the hot path.
- **Inlining** — percentile-threshold hot/cold classification, a
  label-independent entry-count-ratio force-inline for hot loop sites, and a
  bounded force-inline budget.
- **Block/function layout** — hot/cold sections, profile-driven switch lowering
  and case ordering, and conservative (preserve-source-order) layout that never
  perturbs register allocation.
- **Cost-aware devirtualization** — indirect calls whose top target is ≥95%
  (already BTB-predicted) are left indirect; only genuinely multi-valued sites
  are promoted to guarded direct calls.
- **Backend branch inversion** — the hot successor of a `CondBranch` falls
  through (fewer taken branches) without reordering blocks.

Measured effect: both former PGO *regressions* were eliminated — adler32 went
from -17% to neutral, expat from -28% to ~1.01× (faster than plain) — and the
multi-valued devirtualization path is a genuine 1.07× win. The full evidence
lives in `hotspots/` and the PGO A/B harness
(`tests/benchmark/run_pgo_ab.py`).

## Phase 11 — Peephole: Constant Stores, SIB Fold, Accumulator ALU Fold (Complete)

**Goal:** Reduce instruction count in inner loops by adding three new peephole patterns and fixing FPO stack alignment.

**What changed:**
- `src/backend/x86/codegen/memory.rs` — constant-immediate stores bypass the accumulator (`movb $0, addr` instead of `xorl; movq; movb`)
- `src/backend/x86/codegen/peephole/passes/local_patterns.rs` — SIB indexed address folding (3 instructions → 1 for `base + index` array access), accumulator ALU+store folding (4 → 2 for 32-bit ops), `movslq`/`cltq` elimination
- `src/backend/x86/codegen/prologue.rs` — FPO stack alignment fix (frame size must be ≡ 8 mod 16)
- `src/passes/recursion_to_iter.rs` — 8 unit tests for the rec2iter pass

**Results:**
- Sieve: 1.78× → 1.55× (SIB fold + constant stores)
- Arith loop: 75 redundant sign-extensions eliminated (32 movslq + 23 cltq + 20 movl copies)
- MatMul: **fixed** — was crashing with SIGSEGV due to stack misalignment in printf

---

## Phase 12 — Register Allocator Loop-Depth Fix (Complete)

**Goal:** Fix a critical bug in the register allocator's priority computation.

**What changed** (`src/backend/live_range.rs`):
- `build_live_ranges()` was using `value_id` as an index into `block_loop_depth[]`, but `block_loop_depth` is indexed by block index (0..num_blocks), not value ID (sparse u32). This caused most values to get `loop_depth=0` (wrong), leading to incorrect priorities and unnecessary spilling.
- Fix: build a `value_id → defining_block` map and compute `max_use_depth` (maximum loop depth across all use sites). Priority now uses `max(def_depth, max_use_depth)`, ensuring values defined outside a loop but used heavily inside it get correct inner-loop priority.

**Results:**
- Sieve: outer loop variable `i` promoted from stack to `%ebx`, eliminating 1 stack load per inner-loop iteration
- All benchmarks: more correct allocation decisions across the board

---

## Phase 13 — Peephole: Sign-Extension, Phi-Copy Coalesce, Loop Rotation (Complete)

**Goal:** Reduce instruction count in inner loops through assembly-level pattern matching.

**What changed** (`src/backend/x86/codegen/peephole/`):
- Sign-extension fusion: fold `movslq + addq` into `addl` when high bits are dead
- Phi-copy coalescing: eliminate `movq` between phi dest and backedge source
- Loop rotation: move condition check to end of loop, eliminating one unconditional jump

**Results:**
- Sieve inner loop: 8 → 6 instructions
- ~1.1× GCC -O2 on sieve (parity on most other benchmarks)

---

## Phase 14 — Correctness Hardening: SQLite (Complete)

**Goal:** Fix correctness bugs that prevented real-world projects from compiling and running.

**Test target:** SQLite 3.45 amalgamation (260K lines, single-file C).

**31 bugs fixed** across:
1. **Peephole optimizer** (6): dead reg elimination, loop rotation, fuse_add_sign_extend, fuse_signext_and_move, indirect call
2. **Register allocator** (4): phi coalesce linked list, phi coalesce cross-block uses, phi coalesce multi-block loop body, callee-save boundary
3. **Stack layout** (5): callee-save padding, slot alias preservation, cross-block alias, multi-def alias, phi incoming protection
4. **Call codegen** (3): indirect call stack corruption, stack arg RSP tracking, FPO stack_base
5. **Frame/addressing** (3): RSP/RBP mode leak, variadic FPO override, emit_instr_rbp FPO
6. **Value handling** (4): alloca Copy materialization, post-decrement volatile, GVN volatile bypass, emergency spills
7. **SIB/indexed addressing** (2): register conflict check, Phase 9 stale register disable
8. **Jump table** (1): i128 overflow protection
9. **Other** (3): operand_to_callee_reg fallback, liveness phi extension, debug infrastructure

**Results:**
- SQLite fully works: CREATE TABLE, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT with WHERE/ORDER BY/LIMIT, JOIN, subqueries, GROUP BY, UNION ALL, transactions, prepared statements, aggregates, typeof/coalesce/CASE
- 18/18 compatibility tests pass
- Build flags: `CCC_NO_PEEPHOLE=1 CCC_DISABLE_PASSES=vectorize,gvn`

---

## Phase 15 — Peephole Re-enablement for SQLite (Complete)

**Goal:** Re-enable the peephole optimizer for SQLite by identifying and fixing/disabling crashing passes.

**Infrastructure added** (`src/backend/x86/codegen/peephole/passes/mod.rs`):
- `CCC_PEEPHOLE_SKIP=pass1,pass2,...` — disable specific sub-passes by name
- `CCC_NO_PEEPHOLE_PHASE1..7` — disable entire phases
- Skip guards applied across all phases where passes are invoked (Phase 1, 3, 4b)

**Three bugs identified via binary search:**
1. `fuse_signext_and_move` — rax liveness scan had 12-line window; large functions use rax beyond it. Fixed: scan to barrier, conservative default.
2. `eliminate_dead_reg_moves` — jmp-following crossed basic block boundaries unsoundly (ignored CondJmp taken paths). Fixed: removed jmp-following.
3. `fold_base_index_addressing` — crashes on subquery compilation. Under investigation.

**Results:**
- 22 of 25 peephole sub-passes now active on SQLite
- Build flags: `CCC_PEEPHOLE_SKIP=signext_move,dead_regs,base_index CCC_DISABLE_PASSES=vectorize,gvn`
- All 11 SQLite stress tests pass, 18/18 compat tests pass

---

## Remaining Gap to GCC

On the canonical benchmark suite and workload-derived kernels, LCCC is within
~1.0–1.5× of GCC -O2 on most workloads, and **ahead** of GCC on several
(fib/tail-recursion via TCE, reduction vectorization, several vectorized
kernels). The A/B methodology, raw numbers, and per-kernel ratios live in
`tests/benchmark/` and `docs/history/2026-06-benchmark-analysis.md`; the PGO-specific A/B is
`tests/benchmark/run_pgo_ab.py`.

| Source | Gap | Addressable? |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| Accumulator-based codegen | ~1.2–1.5× on ALU-heavy code | Partial — MachInst ISel expansion narrowed it; full block-level MachInst remains |
| Register allocation quality (remat, segments, second-chance) | gzip `longest_match` 118 vs 0 stack-mem; inflate 15× | **Open** — not a from-scratch rewrite; see RA backlog |
| Call-heavy / outlined-code overhead | ~1.2× where the base inliner is conservative | In progress — PGO force-inline + inlining cost-model refinements |
| Link-time optimization (LTO) | ~1.1× general | Future |
| Instruction scheduling | ~1.1× on latency-bound code | Future |
| Auto-vectorizer breadth (NEON/RVV) | variable | Future — core x86 FP vectorizer is at parity |

The goal is to make LCCC-compiled programs fast enough for real systems
software — within ~1.5× of GCC on typical workloads, with targeted wins ahead of
GCC where LCCC's pattern-based passes (TCE, reduction vectorization, PGO)
excel.
